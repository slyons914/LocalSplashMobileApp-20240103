This is a new React Native (Opens in new window or tab) project, bootstrapped using @react-native-community/cli .

Getting Started
Note: Make sure you have completed the React Native - Environment Setup (Opens in new window or tab) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

Step 1: Start the Metro Server
First, you will need to start Metro, the JavaScript bundler that ships with React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

yarn start
Step 2: Start your Application
Let Metro Bundler run in its own terminal. Open a new terminal from the root of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your Android or iOS app:

For Android
yarn android
For iOS
yarn ios
If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in your Android Emulator or iOS Simulator shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
